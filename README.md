### D3-challenge

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). I used D3 to create a scatter plot bwtween two of the data variables, each state is represented within the circle elements. CSS and HTML were also used to run this app.
