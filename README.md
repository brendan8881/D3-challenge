### D3-challenge

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). I used D3 to create a scatter plot of the correlation between poverty and a lack of healthcare, each state is represented within the circle elements. A tooltip is deployed by hovering over each state, this allows the client to see the percentage of the population that lives in poverty and the percentage of the population that lacks healthcare. CSS and HTML are also utilized to run this app.
